# 1. Design Log: Why? Just why?

I've been learning Go for some months and have started to build some applications with it. This blog for instance is a server side rendered application built using Go. I also tried implementing a few more things at work in Go. One project even made it to production. I can't say much about the experience except that it was equal parts exhilirating and nerve-wracking.  

Being (kinda) new and designed for low level programming, one thing I noticed was that I was writing a lot of code. Typically in my applications, I would have a utilities folder but as it burgeoned in size and I kept repeating the same functions in each project, I figured hey - why not externalize this and have all my apps reference the functions in one module? Yep. That's it. That's what inspired go-utilities. 

This is mostly a learning experience. I have all my code up on Github here. I'm open to any code reviews or suggestions through this email -> chisomochiweza@proton.me.
