# 1. Dev log: Get it out there, man - Get it out there man.

Something I'm not proud of is how much of a maladaptive perfectionist I can be. There are high-functioning perfectionists - you know the ones that will wear themselves to the bone to get things perfect. And then there are some like me. The ones that will stall projects and not release them till they're perfect. 

To combat this unhelpful habit (it cost me projects and relationships) - I've been trying to take the advice found in ["Software Engineering at Google"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book). Get it out there. First - It was helpful to know that I was not alone (There is literally an entire section in it known as ["Help me Hide my Code"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch02.html#help_me_hide_my_code)) but also that there was a way around it. Get it out there. Circumvent the tick in your brain that widens in fear when something isn't perfect and say actually, this is enough. 

The development of this blog largely represents this. I created the initial skeleton; served up an HTML introducting the site and hosted it on Render. It is far from perfect. Far from done. Nevertheless, I hope the experience of getting this out there teaches me an important lesson I have struggled to get in my mind. 

Get it out there man.
