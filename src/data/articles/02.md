# Personal Development: Transitioning from programmer to software engineer.

Software developer, software engineer, systems developer, web developer, programmer - I get it, I get it;
The terms feel like synonyms of each other but bear with me for a bit. I like being intentional about
communicating what it is I do and the best way to do that is be clear about my title. So that is partly
what this post will be about.

I started calling myself a programmer for a number reasons. The first is that I enjoy the process of programming by itself a bit more than I enjoy creating software products and I wanted to emphasize that.
Software developers don't always need to code to build good products. Sometimes they can leverage pre-existing technologies to construct some useful and sometimes ingenious solutions to solve their clients problems. I, on the other hand am a programmer and will biase to solving any problem with my programming skills. Any task in my mind is immediately decomposed into a program or set of programs and in turn, the instructions that need to be written to the computer.

1. Most useful software is a collection of systems and learning how best to orchestrate that system is more valuable.
2. Software engineering is a human activity. Successful software depends on human relationships.
