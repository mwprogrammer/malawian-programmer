# Design Log : MVC, MVC, MVC!

It's really funny how prescriptive certain patterns are until you're building something and you're like you know what - I think this problem has been solved before. 

I'm talking about MVC. I currently have a Go http server which serves an index.html file. As I was thinking about including more logic like how I'd handle templating or dynamically add certain sections to my blog - it dawned on me that perhaps gleaning some ideas from MVC could inspire elegant organization of my code. 

I never thought I'd be happy to see MVC. I used to think MVC's simplicity encouraged abuse and forced developers to bloat their code to enjoy a few abstractions. Moreover I want to maintain Go's principle of simplicity as much as possible. 

Nevertheless the more I thought about it; The more I became more open to the idea of reading about MVC and thinking about how I can implement it in Go. Maybe it could be possible to come up with a simpler implementation for my blog.
