# Personal Development: Transitioning from programmer to software engineer.

Software developer, software engineer, systems developer, web developer, programmer - I'm sure you're wondering what's with the numerous titles for what essentially seems to be the same thing but please; bear with me for this post.

Words mean something to me and from the start; I've been intentional about calling myself a programmer for a number reasons. The first is that I enjoy the process of programming by itself a bit more than I enjoy creating software products and I wanted to emphasize that. Software developers don't always need to code to build good products. Sometimes they can leverage pre-existing technologies to construct some useful and sometimes ingenious solutions to solve their clients problems. I, on the other hand am a programmer and will biase to solving any problem with my programming skills. Any task in my mind is immediately decomposed into a program or set of programs and in turn, the instructions that need to be written to the computer.

1. Most useful software is a collection of systems and learning how best to orchestrate that system is more valuable.
2. Software engineering is a human activity. Successful software depends on human relationships.
