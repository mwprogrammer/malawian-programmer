# The best way to learn is to teach.

As I mentioned in my previous post, a goal of mine is to be a software engineer and that includes getting comfortable with knowledge sharing. I recently signed up to give a talk. With it I am killing two birds with one stone; both deepening my knowledge in the subject and also networking with other developers in my area. Wish me luck as I prepare!
